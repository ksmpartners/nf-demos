# Introduction
This directory contains assets required to run the [nf-core/fetchngs](https://github.com/nf-core/fetchngs) pipeline (release tag 1.11.0) in Domino. For more information about this pipeline, see its [Github repository](https://github.com/nf-core/fetchngs).

This pipeline requires [Nextflow速](https://www.nextflow.io/) 0.7.1 or higher.

# Compute Environment Prerequisites
Prior to running the pipeline, all of the environments named in [fetchngs.config](./fetchngs.config) must be installed in the local Domino instance.

# Running the Pipeline
Prior to running the pipeline, set the following shell variables. This is not strictly necessary, but it does make it easier to read the `nextflow` command provided below.
```bash
# outputdir is the directory parent of the [Nextflow速](https://www.nextflow.io/) work directory. It must be in shared storage, such as a Domino dataset directory or an external data volume.
outputdir=/mnt/data/fetchngs

# fetchngsdir is the directory that contains the fetchngs [Nextflow速](https://www.nextflow.io/) pipeline. If this is not available locally, it can be loaded directly from the web by specifying fetchngsdir=nf-core/fetchngs
fetchngsdir=/mnt/code

# configdir is the location of the directory that contains this README
configdir=/mnt/imported/code/nf-configs/fetchngs
```
After setting the above shell variables, run [Nextflow速](https://www.nextflow.io/):
```bash
nextflow -trace nextfuse run $fetchngsdir \
  -c $configdir/fetchngs.config \
  -w $outputdir/work \
  --input $configdir/sra_ids_short.csv \
  --outdir $outputdir/outdir
```
The above runs the Fetchngs workflow with a single SRA ID. To run with multiple (10, in fact), try replacing `--input $configdir/sra_ids_short.csv` in the above command with `--input $configdir/sra_ids_test.csv`. This included file is identical to the [example input file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nf-core/test-datasets/fetchngs/sra_ids_test.csv) named in the [Fetchngs README](https://github.com/nf-core/fetchngs).
